# Nutrition-App

The Health App is a Streamlit-based web application designed to analyze food items from images and provide detailed nutritional and environmental impact information. The app leverages Google's Generative AI (Gemini) to process the uploaded food image and generate a comprehensive analysis in JSON format. This analysis includes dietary components, total calories, health assessments, macro and micro nutrient details, health recommendations, allergy warnings, and environmental impact metrics.
